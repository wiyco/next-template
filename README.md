### 1. clsx & tailwind-merge

By using these two packages, you can concatenate class names and prevent duplication in Tailwind.

### 2. [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes)

For applying color themes.

This package supports light mode and dark mode by default.

### 3. [nextui](https://nextui.org/docs/guide/introduction)

I love this UI library.

### 4. [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion)

Love ❤️

### 5. [swr](https://swr.vercel.app)

Useful libraries for client-side (means: `use client`) fetching.

### 6. [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/docs)

It's foolish to handle form control without using this library.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> [@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers) required to use [Zod](#7-zod) for form validation. (already included in the package)

### 7. [zod](https://zod.dev)

The use cases are endless, from server-side type validation to client-side form validation.

### 8. [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide)

This package is used for testing (such as unit tests).
